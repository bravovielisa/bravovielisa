# My name is Elisa and these are some facts about me:  



📈 *I'm economist with technological skills working as data scientist. More than one year experienced professional, passionate about data.*  
🏭 *My critical-analytical spirit and my interest in knowing and understanding the profile of different companies led me to venture into the world of auditing. During that period I developed my technical and functional business knowledge.*
